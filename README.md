# The Labyrinthian

Welcome to The Labyrinthian Maze Solver project, developed by [Abdelrahman Mostafa](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanMoustafa) and [Amr Tamer](https://github.com/AmrTamer23). This C++ program utilizes the SFML library to visualize and solve mazes. The solver employs a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path from the maze's start to end.

## Overview

The Labyrinthian Maze Solver is designed to provide an interactive environment for maze creation, visualization, and solving. Users can construct mazes and watch as the solver algorithm navigates through them, finding the shortest route. The program features interactive dialog windows to provide user information and feedback.

## Features

- Interactive maze creation and modification.
- Real-time visualization of maze solving.
- Shortest path calculation using a breadth-first search algorithm.
- Interactive dialog windows to guide user interactions.
- Sound effects and music to enhance the user experience.
- Interaction with the program:
   - Left-click to add/remove walls in the maze.
   - Right-click to reposition the robot.
   - Press Enter to initiate the maze-solving process.
   - Press Space to skip dialog windows.
